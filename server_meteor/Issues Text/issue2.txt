The world was shocked when the autonomous region of Western Bohemia voted by popular referendum to form an independent nation. The transition was swift, with both the EU and the newly elected Jan Hus Party taking the hard line. However, one of the largest companies from the new country is Kartenzeichner, a mapping company whose products have been used many self-driving research projects throughout Europe. Kartenzeichner have requested access to the Single Digital Market, arguing that their work is crucial to retaining the relevancy of the European tech sector. Currently, the Single Digital Market was restricted to only companies with permanent headquarters in Europe, which Silicon Valley has long called unfair. Kartenzeichner argues that they began their company in the EU, and remind the Commission that they are a large contributor to software development across the continent.
