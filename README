How to use this simulation:

1. Get a group of friends or students, preferably together in the same room.
2. Print out the simulation.pdf file.
3. Split the group into two teams and assign one the European Commission and one Silicon Valley interests, and give them the instructions which pertain to them (7 pages each).
4. Find your IP address, and have everyone with a laptop go to <your_ip_address>:3000.
5. Have the participants put in their name and the group they are working with.
6. Explain the simulation: Give a short entry about how relations between the EU and the US are rocky today, and how you want to explore percepectives of both sides. Explain how one of each team's goals is cooperative (technological development), one is competative (Sales), and one is independent (Opinion). Stress that the teams should try to hit as many goals as possible.
7. Have the teams go through the 5 issues, giving the teams two to three minutes to debate and negiotiate. Let them read the corresponding page to each issue.
8. Have fun! There's no right way to do this, but it can prove a useful tool for understanding EU/US relations
